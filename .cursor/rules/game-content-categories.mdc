## Category to Group Mapping
Currently implemented mapping for Raw Materials group:
- "Raw Materials" → "rawMaterials"
- "Fuel elements" → "rawMaterials"
- "Special elements" → "rawMaterials"
- "Harvested Agricultural Substance" → "rawMaterials"
- "Soul Fragment" → "rawMaterials"
- "Recycled Minerals" → "rawMaterials"

## Item Type Determination Logic
1. Check manual category mapping first
2. Examine infobox type (_infobox_type field)
3. Fallback to category-based detection
4. Default to "unknown" if no match

## Expansion Strategy
When specific categories are requested, the scraper automatically expands to include all related categories that map to the same group, ensuring complete data collection for related items.
