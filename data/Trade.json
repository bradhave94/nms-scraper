A relic left by a slumbering guardian, keeping sentry over ancient creature burial grounds.\n\nWarning: Disturbing the eye may disturb the slumber of living stone guardians. Ensure re-animated guardians are defeated before storing this relic in the home.\n\nwhen you find a vigilant stone, be prepared to fight, run, or have your ship near you. Stone guardians are a serious jump scare. They are only to be messed with by the most insanely brave individual. Shooting them with your ship’s weapons also works.",
