The base first must be activated, which checks to ensure no other base computer in the area has claimed part of the nearby territory.  If activation is successful, it will create a buildable area around itself. This will enable the construction of all base components found in the Build Menu.\n\nOnce a base is established, the Base Computer can also be interacted with to rename the base, change the base's thumbnail screenshot or delete the base altogether, which removes both the Base Computer and everything constructed around it.",

The same location on other modes will not be claimed prior to the Permadeath and Expeditions game mode bases. \n* The name associated with the base computer can be changed and if it is done before using a teleporter associated with it, that name will be on the selection list of other teleporters.\n* Once the player has reached a certain point in the Alone Amidst the Stars mission, the base computer will begin to uncover useful blueprints from its archives every 90 minutes as part of the Base Computer Archives mission.\n*It is possible to find procedurally generated unclaimed base computers out in the wild, meaning the player is able to go through a portal, claim the base, go back through the portal, go to the Space Anomaly's teleporter and teleport to the claimed base.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/gkw9j4/get_yourself_to_euclid_core_in_no_time_unclaimed/ Unclaimed wild base computer in Euclid]</ref>\n* If you delete a base, it will not be possible to reclaim the area immediately, as it will still be claimed. This effect wears off after approximately three days; as the claim on the area is then removed from the servers; following the deletion of the base. After that, anyone, including you, can claim the site again.\n* The base computer can now be picked up and moved within the bounds of the base (added feature, as of Update 3.73). The centre of the base does not change. Moving the base computer is only moving the item; not moving the potential area of the base.\n*If you place a second base computer in the area of another base computer, you will be able to place it down, but unable to claim a the area.
