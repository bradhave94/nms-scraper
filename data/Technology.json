You will also become invisible to sentinels, but not to predators (this is a bug).\n*By continuously tapping the secondary fire button, the blue outline will also completely disappear from your perspective as well as from other first-person perspectives (this is an exploit allowing you to interfere with the charge depletion rate at will). However, by using this action, sentinels and predators will follow your trail and you will appear as a flickering outline for other players currently using third person mode.
