They can be purchased, mined from raw elements on the ground of planets (either by hand or with an Autonomous Mining Unit), mined from asteroids in space, harvested from plants, collected from the air (with an Atmosphere Harvester or Oxygen Harvester), given to you as gifts from animals you befriend, found in crates and containers on planet surfaces, and harvested by killing plants, animals and even sentinels. The abundance of elements varies significantly from one planet to another, and may be totally absent on a particular planet. As a result, some resources are easiest to obtain in ways other than mining.\n\nResources may also be converted into other resources with the use of the three different sized refiners.",
