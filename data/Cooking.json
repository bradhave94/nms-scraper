They are a multifunctional device that can extract resources, scan / analyze and record fauna, flora and minerals, excavate terrain, and even eliminate obstacles and disturbances (using the latter function). \n\nHowever, if you don't install each technology (or repair tech slots if broken, in the case of found Multi-Tools, rather than purchased ones), you won't be able to use each respective feature.\n\nIn most cases, especially early on, the only function available by default is the basic Mining Beam and melee attack, and possibly a single weapon type, the most common of which being the Boltcaster.\n\nThere are many functions that seem to have nothing to do with the multi-tool, but are actually related. For example, the Analysis Visor that provides the compass display at the top of the HUD is also effective only when it is installed in the multi-tool.\n\nDepending on the setting, the player's hands will be extended or shown. Upon starting a new game, you might think of it as a little more than a makeshift dowsing rod, but you'll soon find that it's an important piece of equipment that will cover a large part of your activities while exploring on foot. Multi-tools will be an important part of the Journey, along with your Exosuit and Starships\n\nThe Waveform Focuser N56-P, which comes as a default in many game modes, has a small number of slots and is not suitable for versatility. It is recommended not to put up with the initial equipment for too long. Save up your money to buy something, or pick it up somewhere and grab some new equipment as soon as possible.",

The selected weapon is displayed in the Weapon Indicator, which is part of the user interface while an avatar is on foot.
